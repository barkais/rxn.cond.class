\title{Clean Correlated Features Based on Multiple Criteria}
\usage{
clean_correlated_features(
  data,
  outcome_col = dim(data)[2],
  corr_threshold = 0.9,
  method = "correlation",
  outcome_type = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the features and outcome.}

\item{outcome_col}{A character string specifying the name of the outcome column.}

\item{corr_threshold}{A numeric value specifying the threshold for identifying highly correlated features. Defaults to 0.9.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method to choose between correlated features. Options include:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"correlation"}: Select based on higher absolute correlation with the outcome.
  \item \code{"mutual_information"}: Select based on higher mutual information with the outcome.
  \item \code{"feature_importance"}: Select based on higher feature importance from a random forest model.
  \item \code{"variance"}: Select based on higher variance in the feature values.
}
Defaults to \code{"correlation"}.}

\item{outcome_type}{A character string specifying the type of the outcome. Options are:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"numeric"}: Use if the outcome is continuous.
  \item \code{"categorical"}: Use if the outcome is categorical.
  \item \code{"auto"}: Automatically detect the type of the outcome. Defaults to \code{"auto"}.
}}
}
\value{
A cleaned data frame where correlated features have been removed based on the chosen criterion.
}
\description{
This function cleans up highly correlated features in a dataset using a user-defined threshold and a selection criterion.
Users can choose to retain the feature with the higher correlation to the outcome, higher mutual information,
higher feature importance from a random forest, or higher variance.
}
\details{
The function computes the correlation matrix for the input features and identifies pairs of features
that exceed the specified correlation threshold. For each pair of correlated features, the function selects
one feature to retain based on the selected \code{method}.

- When using \code{"correlation"}, the function retains the feature with the higher absolute correlation to the outcome.
- When using \code{"mutual_information"}, mutual information is computed to select the feature that provides more information about the outcome.
- The \code{"feature_importance"} method fits a random forest model to calculate feature importance and selects the more important feature.
- The \code{"variance"} method retains the feature with the higher variance.

The function works with both numeric and categorical outcome variables. It automatically adjusts calculations
based on the type of the outcome, which can be inferred by the function or specified by the user.


# Example 1: Using correlation to clean features (numeric outcome)
data(iris)
cleaned_data <- clean_correlated_features(data = iris, outcome_col = "Sepal.Length",
                                          corr_threshold = 0.8, method = "correlation")

# Example 2: Using mutual information to clean features (categorical outcome)
iris$Species <- as.factor(iris$Species)
cleaned_data <- clean_correlated_features(data = iris, outcome_col = "Species",
                                          corr_threshold = 0.8, method = "mutual_information", outcome_type = "categorical")

# Example 3: Using feature importance from a random forest (numeric outcome)
cleaned_data <- clean_correlated_features(data = iris, outcome_col = "Sepal.Length",
                                          corr_threshold = 0.8, method = "feature_importance")
