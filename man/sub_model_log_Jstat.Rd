\title{J Statistic-based Submodel Logistic Regression}
\usage{
sub_model_log_Jstat(
  data,
  out.col = which(colnames(data) == "class"),
  min = 1,
  max = floor(dim(data)[1]/5),
  ordinal = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing the data.}

\item{out.col}{The column number of the outcome variable. Defaults to the "class" column.}

\item{min}{The minimum number of predictor variables to include in combinations. Defaults to 1.}

\item{max}{The maximum number of predictor variables to include in combinations. Defaults to one-fifth of
the number of rows in the dataset.}

\item{ordinal}{A boolean indicating whether to fit an ordinal logistic regression (`TRUE`) or a multinomial
logistic regression (`FALSE`). Defaults to `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the top 10 models sorted by minimum J statistic. The output includes:
        - `formula`: The model formula.
        - `Min J Stat`: The minimum J statistic across all classes (3 decimal places).
        - `McFadden R2`: McFadden's R-squared value.
        - `Smallest Class`: The name of the smallest class in the dataset.
}
\description{
This function is a variant of sub_model_log that ranks models using the minimum J statistic
(Youden's Index) across all classes instead of McFadden's R². This makes it particularly
suitable for imbalanced classification problems where performance on minority classes is important.
}
\details{
The key difference from sub_model_log is the evaluation metric:
- sub_model_log uses McFadden's R² to assess overall model fit
- sub_model_log_Jstat uses minimum J statistic to focus on class-specific performance

The J statistic (Sensitivity + Specificity - 1) is calculated for each class, and the minimum
value is used for ranking to ensure good performance even on the most challenging class.
