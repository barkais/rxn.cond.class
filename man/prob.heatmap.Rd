\title{Probability Heatmap Plot}
\usage{
prob.heatmap(model, data, plot.title, conformation)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted classification model used to make predictions.}

\item{data}{A dataset with the same structure as the training data, including the true class labels.}

\item{plot.title}{The title to be displayed on the plot.}

\item{conformation}{A subtitle or caption to be displayed on the plot (e.g., model version or information).}
}
\value{
A heatmap plot visualizing the predicted probabilities for each class, along with
indicators for correct and incorrect predictions.
}
\description{
This function generates a heatmap to visualize the predicted probabilities of class membership
for a classification model using `ggplot2`. It highlights correct and incorrect predictions
with different colors and displays the predicted probabilities for each class as part of the plot.
}
\details{
- **Predictions and Probabilities**:
  - The function predicts the class membership for each instance in the dataset and also retrieves
    the predicted class probabilities from the model.
  - These probabilities are converted into percentages and visualized in the heatmap.
  - Each row represents an observation, and the columns represent the predicted probabilities for each class.
- **Color Coding**:
  - Correct predictions are colored green.
  - Misclassifications where the second-highest probability corresponds to the true class are colored orange.
  - Other misclassifications are colored red.
- **Heatmap**:
  - The heatmap shows the predicted probabilities using a gradient from white to blue.
  - Text labels show the exact probability values in each tile.
  - For each observation, the true class is indicated by a separate tile and labeled with its class number.
- **Customization**:
  - The title and caption of the plot can be customized via the function parameters.
