Description: An R package designed for classification modeling, probability analysis, and data sampling 
    with a focus on understanding and visualizing model performance. The package provides tools to handle 
    class imbalance, interpret classification probabilities, and create heatmaps to visualize prediction 
    certainty. It also includes functionality for similarity-based sampling, allowing users to select 
    representative samples from imbalanced datasets based on similarity to class-specific feature vectors.
